			<h1>Favorite Book Series</h1>
			<p>
			The Percy Jackson series is one of my favorite book series from middle to high school because of its unique blend of Greek mythology and modern-day storytelling. It introduced me to the 
			facinating world of Greek myths and the interesting stories it has within. I enjoy how the series takes well-known Greek gods, monsters, and characters and puts a fresh spin on them, making them 
			relatable and accessible to modern readers. The characters are complex and endearing, and the plot is full of twists and turns that keep me engaged from start to finish.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another reason why I enjoy the Percy Jackson series is because it has a strong focus on friendship and loyalty. The friendship between Percy, Annabeth, and Grover is at the heart of the series,
			and it's heartwarming to see how they support and care for each other through thick and thin. The series also explores the theme of identity and acceptance, as Percy grapples with his identity as 
			a demigod and tries to find his place in the world. Overall, the Percy Jackson series is a captivating story that has something for everyone, and it was the book the got me into reading.
